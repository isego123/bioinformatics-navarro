Comparing results with paper: 
```https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/35/19/3599/5372677```

Implemented here:
```https://github.com/maickrau/GraphAligner/tree/PaperExperiments```

## Installing
---
Install boost, for Linux

---
```sudo apt install libboost-all-dev```

## Usage
---
For starting use compile-execute.sh scrypt which compiles and then executes program

---
```./compile-execute.sh```
